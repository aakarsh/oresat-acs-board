## Controller PCB for OreSat reaction wheels and magnetorquers

The attitude control system (ACS) inside oresat needs to orientate the position of the cubesat in space. This will be acheived in two ways; With brushless DC motors (BLDC) and with Magnetorquers. We are designing a PCB that controls both systems.
